====================
README for fetchtag
====================

fetchtag can automatically update tags of audio files by searching the Internet. It is written in C, and Lua scripts are used as extensions for searching on different sites. Currently it only supports a Chinese music website(music.douban.com), but some other sites will be added in the future. You can also write your own Lua scripts for any sites you like.


Dependencies
------------

fetchtag uses `Taglib <taglib.github.com>`_ for editing audio file tags. 

You should also have `Lua <www.lua.org>`_ installed for running extensions.
